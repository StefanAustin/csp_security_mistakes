# Cloud Service Provider security mistakes
This page lists security mistakes by cloud service providers (AWS, GCP, and Azure). These are public mistakes on the cloud providers' side of the shared responsibility model. This may be CVEs or bug bounties for issues in the services they run, but could also be in client software they provide, guidance they have given, failed audit tests in their SOC 2 Type 2, security incidents they have had, and more.  

Whether an issue is included or not is hard to define and thus opinionated.  For my definition of a mistake, I am not including business decisions such as AWS releasing a service before it has Cloudtrail auditing support, or some technical decisions by the cloud providers such as the ease with which an S3 bucket can be made public.  Some technical decisions are concerning enough to be listed here though. I'm avoiding GSuite and Office365 issues. I am not including security incidents at the companies that did not seem to impact the cloud services for customers (ex. when Amazon's Twitch was hacked, it didn't impact AWS customers), or security incidents of their customers (ex. Capital One's breach on AWS).

The purpose of this project is to ensure there is a record of these mistakes. Although I believe using cloud providers is often a much better decision than self-hosting, it's important to hold them accountable by recognizing their security mistakes.

Where possible I also want to ensure customers know what steps they can take to detect or prevent the issues identified.  Mitre, which is the organization that manages CVEs, has generally avoided providing CVEs for security issues of the cloud providers under the assumption that all issues can be resolved by the cloud provider and therefore do not need a tracking number. This view is sometimes incorrect, and even when the issue can be resolved by the cloud provider, I still believe it warrants having a record.  Similar views are expanded on by Alon Schindel and Shir Tamari from Wiz.io in their post [Security industry call to action: we need a cloud vulnerability database](
 https://www.wiz.io/blog/security-industry-call-to-action-we-need-a-cloud-vulnerability-database).
